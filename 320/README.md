# Applied Algorithmics 

This was the third year applied algorithmics paper, all code in this folder was created originally by me with no "skeleton" code used

A lot of the code is somewhat hard to read. There are parts of code that should be put in functions etc, however this has been avoided to speed up the code as was required for this paper and has been done deliberately.

My overall marks for these uploaded assignments was 100%
